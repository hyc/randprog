Make it.  Move the compiled `randprog' program to where you want it.

Boost 1.34 is required.  If you need to override the default Boost on
your system, pass the --with-boost=location argument to the configure
script.

Tested on Cygwin, Ubuntu Feisty, Ubunty Gutsy.

To compile the programs output by `randprog', the following header
files need to be installed in the C compiler's include search path:

  platform_avr.h
  platform_generic.h
  random_runtime.h

## End of file.
