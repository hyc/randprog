Please send bug reports and fixes to Eric Eide and John Regehr.

This program is based on an earlier random program generator written by Bryan
Turner <bryan.turner@pobox.com>.

The default seed is hardcoded. Provide a new seed as the only argument on the
command line. The seed is expected to be a hexadecimal string. A suitable string
can be retrieved using:

WALLET_ADDRESS="a valid Monero wallet address"
curl -X POST http://node.moneroworld.com:18089/json_rpc -d "{\"method\": \"getblocktemplate\", \"params\": {\"reserve_size\": 8, \"wallet_address\": \"$WALLET_ADDRESS\"}}"
